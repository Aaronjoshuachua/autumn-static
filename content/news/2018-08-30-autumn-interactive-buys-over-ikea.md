**BREAKING NEWS** - The mysterious games company from Singapore have for the first time, revealed their faces to the public in the attempt to win the hearts and minds of angry Swedish folks. In a long campaign lasting 6 months, the takeover was finally completed on the 18th of March, 2018.  The new Singaporean owners will be acquiring all funitures for their own office usage, before selling everything else to the general public. 

Nisha and Mango, the new directors of the meatballs and chicken division, will be launching a new line of nasi lemak-flavoured meatballs. "We've always love Crave nasi lemak, a local malay delight, and would like to share its very unique taste to the people of Sweden."
